## Description

  

This project is my attempted at making a professional portfolio using only css. It includes various sections that displays general information about me, some skills the I've obtained, recent projects that I have worked on, as well as a way to contact me.

  

## Features

I've included the features below using strictly css

1. An interface in which content can scroll in the foreground and the background images stay fix.

2. A operational navigation bar that allow user to get directly to a section of their choosing.

3. Projects and contact information that can be access at the click of a button.

  

Whats to come:

1. When the user clicks on of the skills they will directed to a mini project displaying those skills

2. I will install a contact form by implement js, so the user won't have to leave the site to contact me.

3. Instead of there being a button to press to deploy a particular project, the whole corresponding section will be able to redirect user to that application.
